## Remediation Actions Taken

### 1. Updated Next.js
- **Before**: Next.js 14.0.4
- **After**: Next.js 14.2.33
- **File**: `frontend/package.json`
- **Status**: Complete

### 2. Updated ESLint Config
- **Before**: eslint-config-next 14.0.4
- **After**: eslint-config-next 14.2.33
- **File**: `frontend/package.json`
- **Status**: Complete

### 3. Verification
```bash
npm audit
# Result: found 0 vulnerabilities
```

## Security Scanning Setup

### Current Tools Implemented

1. **npm audit** (Primary)
   - Built-in Node.js security scanner
   - No API key required
   - Checks against npm security advisories
   - Usage: `npm run security:scan`

2. **Socket Security CLI** (Optional)
   - Advanced supply chain security
   - Requires API key for full features
   - Configuration: `frontend/.socketsecurity.yml`
   - Usage: `npm run security:socket`
   - Note: Free tier has API limitations

### Available Commands

```bash
# Run security scan
npm run security:scan

# Scan frontend only
npm run security:frontend

# Auto-fix vulnerabilities
npm run security:frontend:fix

# Socket Security (requires API key)
npm run security:socket
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

Security scanning is integrated into CI/CD pipeline:
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- Runs on every push to main branch
- Blocks deployment if critical vulnerabilities found

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
- [x] Update Next.js to 14.2.33
- [x] Run npm audit to verify fixes
- [x] Update CI/CD pipeline with security scanning

### Ongoing Practices
- [ ] Run `npm audit` before each deployment
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated regularly
- [ ] Monitor GitHub security advisories
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Review Socket Security reports (if API access available)

### For Production
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Setup monitoring and logging
- [ ] Regular security audits

## Socket Security Integration

Socket Security CLI is installed but requires proper API permissions. For full functionality:

1. Visit https://socket.dev and sign up
2. Get API token from https://socket.dev/settings/api
3. For paid features, upgrade account
4. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export SOCKET_SECURITY_API_KEY="your_key"
   ```

Alternatively, use the VS Code extension for real-time security insights during development.

## Conclusion

All identified critical vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated. The application now runs on Next.js 14.2.33 with **0 known security vulnerabilities**.

Regular security audits should be performed to maintain this security posture.
